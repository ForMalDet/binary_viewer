Binary Viewer is a tool for binary file discovery using visualizations that may contain patterns.

Loosely based on Cantor.Dust, Binary Viewer was developed September 21-October 8, 2015 after seeing a demo of Cantor.Dust but receiving no response regarding availability.
Since Cantor.Dust was released, another tools have similar functionality and available. Binary Viewer is meant as a reference for those interested but is unlikely to receive active development.

For more information on this and related programs for visualizing binaries see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8--cXwuuFQ&list=PLUyyOw61zxiJXMihb4PjYbGHEgdGxMuY3

To compile Binary Viewer, Qt4 is required.
